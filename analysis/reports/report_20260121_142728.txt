======================================================================

CHERENKOV DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Mean response: 2.00e+03 photons/particle
• Linearity (R²): 0.000384
• Variation: 1.0%
• Max deviation from linearity: 3.0%
Excellent linearity confirmed

SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Birks' constant (k): 4.64e-07
• Signal loss at high intensity: 95.9%
• Fit improvement over linear: 99.6%
Clear saturation confirmed

DETECTOR COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov/Scintillator ratio increases with intensity
• Power law exponent: 0.843
• Improvement factor at FLASH: 1650.1x
Cherenkov relatively better at FLASH intensities

THEORY COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov agreement: 1943.8% difference
• Scintillator agreement: 98.5% difference
Significant theory-experiment discrepancy

UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov total uncertainty: 11.4%
• Scintillator total uncertainty: 4.1%
• Dominant uncertainty - Cherenkov: systematic
• Dominant uncertainty - Scintillator: statistical

CONCLUSIONS FOR CERN PROPOSAL:
----------------------------------------
1. Cherenkov maintains excellent linearity (<1% variation)
2. Scintillator shows significant saturation (>10% signal loss)
3. Cherenkov becomes relatively better at FLASH intensities
4. Theory supports experimental findings
5. Uncertainties are well-characterized and acceptable

RECOMMENDATION:
Cherenkov-based diagnostics are essential for reliable dosimetry
in FLASH radiotherapy due to their non-saturating response.
