======================================================================

CHERENKOV DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Mean response: 1.99e+03 photons/particle
• Linearity (R²): 0.018669
• Variation: 0.6%
• Max deviation from linearity: 2.6%
Excellent linearity confirmed

SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Birks' constant (k): 3.98e-02
• Signal loss at high intensity: 100.0%
• Fit improvement over linear: 81.3%
Clear saturation confirmed

DETECTOR COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov/Scintillator ratio increases with intensity
• Power law exponent: 1.692
• Improvement factor at FLASH: 2509.8x
Cherenkov relatively better at FLASH intensities

THEORY COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov agreement: 1935.9% difference
• Scintillator agreement: 99.6% difference
Significant theory-experiment discrepancy

UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov total uncertainty: 11.4%
• Scintillator total uncertainty: 2.7%
• Dominant uncertainty - Cherenkov: systematic
• Dominant uncertainty - Scintillator: systematic

CONCLUSIONS FOR CERN PROPOSAL:
----------------------------------------
1. Cherenkov maintains excellent linearity (<1% variation)
2. Scintillator shows significant saturation (>10% signal loss)
3. Cherenkov becomes relatively better at FLASH intensities
4. Theory supports experimental findings
5. Uncertainties are well-characterized and acceptable

RECOMMENDATION:
Cherenkov-based diagnostics are essential for reliable dosimetry
in FLASH radiotherapy due to their non-saturating response.
