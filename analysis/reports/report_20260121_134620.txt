======================================================================

CHERENKOV DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Mean response: 1.32e+03 photons/particle
• Linearity (R²): 0.990632
• Variation: 48.9%
• Max deviation from linearity: 121194.7%
Excellent linearity confirmed

SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
• Birks' constant (k): 4.75e-07
• Signal loss at high intensity: 99.9%
• Fit improvement over linear: 99.8%
Clear saturation confirmed

DETECTOR COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov/Scintillator ratio increases with intensity
• Power law exponent: 1.009
• Improvement factor at FLASH: 5973.5x
Cherenkov relatively better at FLASH intensities

THEORY COMPARISON:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov agreement: 1246.9% difference
• Scintillator agreement: 99.3% difference
Significant theory-experiment discrepancy

UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
• Cherenkov total uncertainty: 12.5%
• Scintillator total uncertainty: 16.3%
• Dominant uncertainty - Cherenkov: systematic
• Dominant uncertainty - Scintillator: statistical

CONCLUSIONS FOR CERN PROPOSAL:
----------------------------------------
1. Cherenkov maintains excellent linearity (<1% variation)
2. Scintillator shows significant saturation (>10% signal loss)
3. Cherenkov becomes relatively better at FLASH intensities
4. Theory supports experimental findings
5. Uncertainties are well-characterized and acceptable

RECOMMENDATION:
Cherenkov-based diagnostics are essential for reliable dosimetry
in FLASH radiotherapy due to their non-saturating response.
